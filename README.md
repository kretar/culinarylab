## 🔬 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- WordPress 5.8+
- PHP 7.4+
- MySQL 5.7+

### Installation

#### Local Development with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kretar/culinarylab.git
   cd culinarylab
   ```

2. Start the Docker environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the site at http://localhost:8080

#### Production Installation

1. Download the latest release .zip files for both the theme and plugin
2. In your WordPress admin:
   - Navigate to Appearance → Themes → Add New → Upload Theme
   - Upload and activate the `culinarylab-x.x.x.zip` file
   - Navigate to Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin
   - Upload and activate the `recipe-plugin-x.x.x.zip` file

#### Installing Upgrades

1. Download the latest release .zip files from the [Releases page](https://github.com/kretar/culinarylab/releases)
2. Before upgrading, make a complete backup of your site (files and database)
3. For the theme:
   - In WordPress admin, navigate to Appearance → Themes → Add New → Upload Theme
   - Upload the new `culinarylab-x.x.x.zip` file (WordPress will update the existing theme)
   - The theme update will be applied automatically

4. For the plugin (safest method that preserves your recipe data):
   - Use FTP or your hosting file manager to access your WordPress installation
   - Navigate to `/wp-content/plugins/`
   - Rename the existing `recipe-plugin` folder to `recipe-plugin-old` (this preserves your data while preventing conflicts)
   - In WordPress admin, go to Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin
   - Upload the new `recipe-plugin-x.x.x.zip` file
   - Activate the newly uploaded plugin
   - Verify all recipes are intact with their data
   - If everything works correctly, you can delete the `recipe-plugin-old` folder

5. Alternative plugin update method (for advanced users):
   - Make sure you have a complete database backup
   - Deactivate the Recipe Plugin in WordPress admin
   - Install a plugin like "WP Reset" that can manage plugin deactivation without data loss
   - Delete the plugin files through WordPress
   - Upload and activate the new version
   
6. Verify that all recipes display correctly after the upgrade

## 🧪 Using the Theme

### Creating Recipes

1. Create a new recipe post through the "Recipes" menu item
2. Add mandatory fields:
   - Title - The recipe name
   - Featured Image - Main recipe photo
   - Description - Introduction to the recipe
   - Preparation Time, Cooking Time, Servings, and Difficulty

3. Add ingredients in the format:
   ```
   Amount - Unit - Ingredient
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   200 - grams - All-Purpose Flour
   2 - tablespoons - Olive Oil
   ```

4. Add instructions (one step per line)
   - You can include HTML links to videos: `Mix thoroughly. <a href="https://example.com/video" target="_blank">Watch demonstration</a>`

5. For multi-component recipes, use the "Recipe Sections" meta box to create separate parts with their own ingredients and instructions

### Customization

The theme is designed to be used with minimal customization, but you can:

1. Add your logo via Appearance → Customize → Site Identity
2. Customize menus via Appearance → Menus
3. Add widgets to the sidebar and footer areas
4. Adjust colors by modifying the CSS variables in `style.css`

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the theme or plugin files
2. Test locally using the Docker environment
3. Commit changes following the conventional commits format
4. Create a new tag for releases (will trigger automatic packaging)

## 📦 Release Process

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds and releases:

1. Update version numbers in:
   - `masterchef/style.css`
   - `masterchef/functions.php`
   - `recipe-plugin/recipe-plugin.php`

2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version details

3. Commit changes and create a new tag:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Bump version to x.x.x"
   git tag -a vx.x.x -m "Release version x.x.x"
   git push origin main vx.x.x
   ```

4. GitHub Actions will automatically build and create releases with proper .zip packages
